### Step 5: Start the Application

You have two options to start the application:

#### Option A: Quick Start Script (Recommended)

**Windows:**
```bash
scripts\QUICK_START.bat
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/QUICK_START.sh
./scripts/QUICK_START.sh
```

#### Option B: Manual Start

**Windows:**
```bash
python scripts/start_enhanced_web_interface.py
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
python3 scripts/start_enhanced_web_interface.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
 * Serving Flask app 'web_interface'
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

### Step 6: Access the Web Interface

1. Open your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.)
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5000`
3. **Development Mode**: If `DEV_MODE=True` is set, you'll go directly to the Case Manager
4. **Production Mode**: You'll see the login page - create an account or login
5. After login, you'll see the Case Manager interface where you can create cases and upload UFDR files!

---

### Step 7: Test the Application

1. **Create a Case (if in Production Mode):**
   - From the Case Manager, click "Create New Case"
   - Enter case details (name, description, etc.)
   - Save the case

2. **Upload a Test File:**
   - Click "Upload UFDR File" button
   - Select a ZIP file from `FORENSIC/data/UFDR's(new)/` (if available)
   - Or use your own UFDR JSON or ZIP file
   - The file will be associated with your current case

3. **Try a Query:**
   - Type: `"show messages with external partners"`
   - Click "Analyze" or press Enter
   - You should see results!

4. **Test AI Chat (if LM Studio is running):**
   - Click on the "AI Chat" tab
   - Type a question about your uploaded data
   - The AI should respond with forensic analysis

5. **Export PDF Report:**

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Python is not recognized"

**Solution:**
1. Reinstall Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Make sure to check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
3. Restart your terminal/command prompt

### Issue: "Module not found" or "No module named 'flask'"

**Solution:**
```bash
cd FORENSIC
python scripts/setup_with_lm_studio.py
```

### Issue: "Port 5000 already in use"

**Solution:**
1. Close other applications using port 5000
2. Or wait a few minutes for the port to be released
3. You can also change the port in `web_interface.py` if needed

### Issue: "LM Studio connection failed" or "AI Chat not working"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure LM Studio is installed and running
2. Verify the model `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` is downloaded
3. Start the LM Studio server from the "Local Server" tab
4. Check that the server is running on `http://localhost:1234`
5. Try restarting both LM Studio and the application

### Issue: "Permission denied" (Mac/Linux)

**Solution:**
- Use `python3` instead of `python`
- Or run with appropriate permissions: `sudo python3 ...`

### Issue: "Git is not recognized"

**Solution:**
1. Install Git from https://git-scm.com/downloads
2. Restart your terminal/command prompt

### Issue: Slow AI responses

**Solution:**
- Ensure you're using `Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct`
- Check that your GPU is being utilized in LM Studio
- Close other resource-intensive applications
- For systems with limited VRAM (4GB), consider using quantization in LM Studio

### Issue: "Authentication required" or login issues

**Solution:**
1. **For Development/Testing:**
   - Set environment variable: `export DEV_MODE=True` (Linux/Mac) or `set DEV_MODE=True` (Windows)
   - Or edit `web_interface.py` and set `DEV_MODE = True`
   - This bypasses authentication for easier testing

2. **For Production:**
   - Use the signup page to create an account
   - Login with your credentials
   - If database is missing, run: `python Authentication/setup_database.py`

3. **Database Issues:**
   - Check that `Authentication/evi_scan.db` exists
   - If missing, run the setup script: `python Authentication/setup_database.py`
   - Check file permissions on the database file
